We use cookies on our website, so we want to let you know more about them.

## What are cookies?
Cookies are small text files located in the browser directory of your computer or mobile device. When you visit a website, it can send information back to the browser which then creates the cookie. Every time you revisit the same website it can access the information stored in the cookie. Cookies are not just created by the website you visit, but may also be created by other websites that run adverts, video or other content you view.

The website [All About Cookies](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/) has a more detailed description.

**No personally identifiable information is stored in any Psoriasis Solved cookie**.

## What are cookies used for?

Cookies are used for a number of reasons. They:

- help the website remember your preferences
- help the website remember what’s in your shopping cart
- help improve functionality such as searching or videos
- help monitor the website’s performance

## Functional Cookies
Functional cookies allow a website to provide additional services by remembering your preferences and settings. Katana use a cookie called ‘psoriasissolved.com’ to keep track of whether you have chosen to hide the Cookie notice at the foot of the screen.

Functional cookies may also be set by third parties if you view their content within our website. For example, if we embed a You Tube video in one of our pages then you will receive a Cookie from YouTube to help ensure a smooth video playback experience. We have no control over the content of these cookies.

## Performance Cookies

Performance cookies allow us to keep track of our website analytics. It is highly beneficial for us to know how many visitors we get, where they are visiting from, what the most popular pages are, which blog posts get the most views and what time of day has the least number of visitors (so we know the best time to do maintenance).

We use a third party service to track our analytics. Examples of the cookies they set are _unta, _untb, _umtc and _umtz.

## Advertising Cookies
Third party advertisers will often place cookies to help make advertisements and offers more interesting to you. We have no direct third party advertising on its website.

Psoriasis Solved doesn’t send any personally identifiable information about you to Google. We do, however, use Google’s Demographics and Interests feature, which tells us a little more about the sort of people who visit our site; and Google Remarketing which helps us reconnect with visitors via Google’s Adwords platform.

If you’d rather not have any of your data be used by Google Analytics, you can opt out by using Google’s own [Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Concerns
If you have any concerns about the cookies used on this website, please don’t hesitate to contact us so we can address your concern.
