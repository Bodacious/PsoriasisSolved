title: About Psoriasis Solved

Psoriasis Solved is the personal notes of Gavin Morrice on the subject of psoriasis. The articles on this website focus on a science-based approach approach to building a healthy, sustainable lifestyle that is psoriasis free.

<!-- Hi, my name is Gavin.

I first developed Psoriasis when I was 4 years old, and it severely impacted most of my childhood.

I suffered for about 12 years, sometimes to the point where my entire body had to be wrapped in tar and gauze every day to help relieve the constant itching and pain.

These days though, **Psoriasis isn’t a problem for me**.

Like you probably were, I was told by several doctors that psoriasis was something I'd just have to learn to live with. But I’m a nerd who doesn’t take “you just have to live with it” for an answer.

Instead, I’ve spent over 10 years experimenting on myself. I collected every book, study, journal, and article I could find that was relevant to the treatment of psoriasis, focussing on natural solutions that are scientifically sound.

No drugs. No potions. No voodoo. Just simple, science-based interventions that are proven to:

- improve immune function
- improve mental well-being (surprisingly important)
- improve gut health (even more important)
- improve hormone function

I’ve been amazed by some of the things I’ve learned. For example, did you know that **some cases of Psoriasis can be triggered by bacteria that lives on your teeth?**

I’d like to share everything I’ve learned with you in a collection I’ve called Psoriasis Solved—that’s catchy, right?

## Psoriasis Solved is:
- Written by me, someone who actually understands what it's like to have psoriasis
- Written as simple, easy to follow steps you can put to work right away
- Based on solid, scientific data

## Psoriasis Solved is NOT:
- A scam. I’m not going to try and sell you a “colon-cleanse” kit or anything like that. I was let down by so many of these stupid programs before I took a more sceptical, scientific approach
- A promise of a cure—we still can’t cure autoimmune diseases yet, but you can live without them ever being a problem again
- Medical advice—I’m not a doctor, nor am I trained or certified to give medical advice.

I hope you find the information in these articles interesting. Please remember to subscribe for updates on future posts. -->
